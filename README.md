Code and data for running "bootstrap comparison of attractor dimension" (BCAD). BCAD is a method for *refuting* the existence of causal relations between two observables of a (noisy dynamical) system.

To run, just call  

`python main.py`

You can then look inside `main.py` see how to run it on your data.
